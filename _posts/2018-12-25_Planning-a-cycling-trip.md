My college roommate is getting married in June 2019 in Minnesota.
I love cycling and camping, and thought this would be a good excuse to try cycling across the country.
This blog post is meant to serve as my log of the planning process for such a trip.

Planning tools
======

To plan the journey I'll be using a couple crucial tools.

**Strava** will be used for route planning.
Strava is 'facebook for athletes', and it has excellent tools for route planning that combine shortest distance with 'best route'.
This will allow me to pick roads that are considered good and/or safe by other cyclists.

**Google maps** will be used to mark key destinations such as grocery stores and housing.
I can create a custom map that I can download offline prior to the trip.
This will allow me to view the information on the map while only requiring a GPS (and _not_ data) from my phone, using less battery.
Other things that will be useful are bike shops, gas stations (food/water stops), and I'm sure more I haven't thought of yet.

**warmshowers.org** is a community of touring cyclists.
My goal is to pick a few nights over the course of the trip to stop at someone's home and, well, take a hot shower.
The community is made up of cycling tourists, so I will likely get to hear some interesting stories from others as well.

You can have many headings
