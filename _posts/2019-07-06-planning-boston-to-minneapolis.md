My college roommate is getting married on July 6th, 2019 in Minnesota.
I love cycling and camping, and thought this would be a good excuse to try cycling across the country.
This blog post is meant to serve as my log of the planning process for such a trip.

Planning tools
====

To plan the journey I'll be using a couple crucial tools.

**Strava** will be used for route planning.
Strava is 'facebook for athletes', and it has excellent tools for route planning that combine shortest distance with 'best route'.
This will allow me to pick roads that are considered good and/or safe by other cyclists.

**Google maps** will be used to mark key destinations such as grocery stores and housing.
I can create a custom map that I can download offline prior to the trip.
This will allow me to view the information on the map while only requiring a GPS (and _not_ data) from my phone, using less battery.
Other things that will be useful are bike shops, gas stations (food/water stops), and I'm sure more I haven't thought of yet.

**warmshowers.org** is a community of touring cyclists.
My goal is to pick a few nights over the course of the trip to stop at someone's home and, well, take a hot shower.
The community is made up of cycling tourists, so I will likely get to hear some interesting stories from others as well.

The Route
===============
Although the purpose of this journey is to see the country, I don't have unlimited time.
I want to enjoy the biking, but I also want to get there as soon as possible to see my friends :)
Therefore, I am using Strava to make create the backbone or 'highway' of the route.
Once I have that, I can tweak it to take me to grocery stores, campsites, food and water stops, and warm showers destinations.

Major legs of the trip are:
1. Boston to Niagara Falls
2. Niagara Falls to Sombra, ON
3. Sombra to Muskegon, MI
4. Milwaukee to Saint Paul

Water Crossings
-------
There are two places on the route I need to take a ferry.
The first is to cross from Sombra, ON to Marine City, MI by a company called Bluewater Ferry.
The second is to cross Lake Michigan from Muskegon, MI to Milwaukee, WI by Lake Express.

Campsites

Biking Abroad
===============
The route is going to take me through Canada.
The alternate would be to make a big U South through Ohio and Indiana.
Again, I don't have time, and if I go North I can see Niagara falls for the first time :)

The Gear
===============
You've read this far, time for the fun part :)
