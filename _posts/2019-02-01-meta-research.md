These are the notes from a lab meta discussion on doing research, reading papers, and finding ideas.
The ideas are presented in no particular order.

## Assignment
* Read 3 papers
 - take notes about how you read the papers
 - one enjoyable paper
 - different knowledge levels for each

## Questions
* Why are you reading that research paper?
  - open problems
  - related work
  - advisor told me
  - to implement
  - to learn about a field
  - lit search
  - maintaining knowledge
  - trends in a field
  - interest after conference
  - contains answers to homework
  - seminal papers
* How does one pick a paper to read?
  - number citations
  - by reference
  - by google scholar
  - by author
  - by conference
* To what level of detail should I read?
  - 3 passes (from paper)
  - introduction, background, related work useful if unfamiliar
  - levels depending on knowledge of area
  - find "these are our contrabutions" section
* Is this paper worth reading?
  - too many papers to read everything

## Approaches
* Write why reading to check if you succeeded in reading for your goal
* Be able to explain paper to someone else
  - loose
  - depending on your goal
* Read blogs, Medium articles for high-level entry points
  - take a class
  - read books
* Surveys more useful when you are familiar with a field (truth in this?)
* Find your comfort level for entry point
* Videos at 1.5 speed
* Don't spend all time reading papers
  - Recognize when to stop reading a paper
* Don't always seek to understand every minor detail of a paper
* Recognize what method works for learning a paper or topic
* 4 or 5 hours of _deep work_ per day, use it wisely
* Explore the network of papers
* Read multiple papers at once
  - active compare
* Paired reading
* Have a [good] pen in your hand
* Take breaks
* 3 passes
  1. title, abstract, introduction, and conclusion
  2. key points, figures, references, **problem and solution**
  3. fine details, implementation; be able to re-create
* Watch the talk of the paper
  - Authors may emphasize certain parts more than others
* Look at the paper's code
* Build related work before writing your paper
* Use a whiteboard

## Tools
* Reference manager (stores pdf)
  - Mendeley
  - Zotero
* Powerpoint
* gnuplot
* `matplotlib`

## Reading _Critically_ and _Creatively_
* Wear the skepticism hat, read papers thinking _What is wrong with this?_
* Wear the creativity hat, think _How would I improve this work?_

#### How to write notes
* low-level notes; write while reading
* high-level notes; 2 sentence summary afterwards
