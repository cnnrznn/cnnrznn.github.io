This is a blog post to log the progress and process of building a bike.
My first real bicycle had its frame bent while it was locked in Porter Square, and I'm going to revive it by putting the old parts on a new frame.
I've done basic maintenance on bikes, but never have I built one from scratch.

The parts
======

Salvaged
--------
* handlebars / bar-end shifters
* brakes
* cranks
* chain rings
* rear derailleur
* headset spacers
* stem

New
-------
* Bike Nashbar carbon road frame + fork (https://www.bikenashbar.com/cycling/bikes-frames/frames/nashbar-carbon-road-frame-and-fork-nb-crfs)
* Shimano 105 5700 front derailleur (34.9mm diameter, 2x10 speed)
* Shimano Ultegra 6701 10 speed chain
* Cinelli Vai seat post (31.6mm diameter)

The tools
======

I have a basic bike tool kit from Nashbar, and a torque wrench.
For the tool kit, any brand will do, they seem to be mostly the same.
Key tools to have are a set of hex wrenches, a larger hex for removing the cranks, a chain tool, and a set of wire cutters.
The torque wrench is needed for the headset.
Although it can be done by hand, there are torque values written on the stem that specify tightness.

The process
======

I started by breaking the chain on the old bike.
It's around 7 or 8 years old, and although it's in good conditions (or seems like it), I'm taking the opportunity to get a new one.
With the chain removed I can also remove the rear derailleur.
I cut the cables and housings; these are old and are also due to be replaced.
I put the rear derailleur on the new frame after wiping it down and applying grease to the threads.

Next up is the front derailleur.
Unfortunately, the clamp is the wrong size and I'll need to get one that fits the new frame.
From here, I decide to completely dismantle the old bike and create a complete shopping list for this project.
See _The parts_ section for the shopping list.
