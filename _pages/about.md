Hi! My name is Connor Zanin and I am a PhD student at Northeastern University.
My main research focus is distributed systems.
Computers fail, and I love to think about how applications can be _correct_ and _performant_ in the face of faults.

When I'm not working on computers, I love to be outdoors hiking, climbing, and cycling.
Besides writing computer programs, I roast coffee and work on bikes.
If any of these things sound interesting to you, I write about them under _Blog Posts_ :)
