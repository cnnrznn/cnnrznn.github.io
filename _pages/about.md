Hi! My name is Connor Zanin and I'm a software engineer. As an engineer I'm
passionate about Golang and distributed systems. Checkout [my
Github](https://github.com/cnnrznn) for some fun projects (see pinned repos).

Before industry, I graduated from Northeastern University with a MSc in Computer
Science.  During my time in undergrad and grad school, my research focus was
distributed systems.  Computers fail, and I love to think about how applications
can be _correct_ and _performant_ in the face of faults.

When I'm not working on computers, I love to be outdoors running, climbing, and
cycling.  Currently, I'm primarily a long-distance runner training for 50k+
races.  Some hobbies include coffee roasting, knife sharpening, bike
maintenance, cooking, beer brewing, and reading.
