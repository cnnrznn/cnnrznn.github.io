Hi! My name is Connor Zanin and I recently graduated from Northeastern University with a MSc in Computer Science.
During my time in undergrad and grad school, my research focus was distributed systems.
Computers fail, and I love to think about how applications can be _correct_ and _performant_ in the face of faults.

When I'm not working on computers, I love to be outdoors hiking, climbing, and cycling.
Some hobbies include coffee roasting, knife sharpening, bike maintenance, and cooking.
