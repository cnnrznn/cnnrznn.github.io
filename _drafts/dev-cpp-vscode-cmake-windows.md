Recently, I had a headache of a time setting up my Windows machine for developing c++ programs *without full-blown Visual Studio*.
In this article, I want to outline clearly how I created a working development environment with VSCode, MinGW-w64, and CMake.

### A footnote
In learning about the tooling to do this - I've been a developer within Linux and mac for years now, cut me some slack - I came accross loads of pages that are prefixed with some combination of, "I'm a professor, and this guide is meant for my students only."
This guide is a retaliation to those results appearing on the front page of Google.
No one should be forced to use a professor's hack config they created 15 years ago that allows their students to compile homework by editing a single source file in a hack project.
I hope people find this guide and I hope it makes it easier for others who want to develop more than a bare minimum project.

# Install and configure
In this section, I outline what tools to download, what order to download them in, and how to configure each of them.
There are threee major tools you need to have an effective development workflow: the editor, the compiler, and to make build configuration easy, CMake.

To reiterate, the goal of this project was to create a working build environment *without* using Microsoft's VisualStudio environment.
In theory, if you want to develop on a different operating system - for me it's my mac laptop - this will allow me to do it.
By using CMake I'm not restricted to the Windows ecosystem.

## VSCode: The text editor
