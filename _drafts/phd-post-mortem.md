This winter I will ditch the PhD program at Northeastern and graduate with a
Master's. This is a post I didn't think I would have to write.  But, in doing so
I want to help prevent others from making the same mistakes I did. I want to
analyze why the PhD didn't work for me and add my story to the vast pool of PhD
success and failure tails.
