After the dishes had been cleared from our Thanksgiving dinner, I began a long planned project I had in the back-log.
Several months ago, after trying my hand at beer brewing,
I picked up from my local homebrew store the yeast and nutrients necessary to brew mead.
Simpler than beer - the barest version made only with honey - it seemed like a natural progression
after learning about fermentation and processes for the home brewer.
With excess time and energy, I began the therapeutic process of the boil...

## Mead?

At my apartment I only have equipment for brewing in one gallon batches.
The more sugar-rich "must" provides more food for the yeast than wort, and therefore should produce a more boozy final product; efficient.
Hopefully, the gallon batch of mead will last longer than the beer, which typically is gone in days after opening.

Mead making also comes with the potential for greater flavor combinations.
All beer has the four same ingredients, and while there is a *ton* to explore there, there are no fundamental flavor differences between two beers.
For example, I could do a mead for any kind of fruit.
I could also introduce hops into the boil for a hop-y mead, or spices such as vanilla.
The possibilities, and flavor combination, seem more creative and varied.
