# Abstract

In recent years, gaming hasn't been as fun for me as it was when I was younger.
When I sit down to play a game, I'm not inspired to choose new games to learn, and I don't want to replay the same 10 games I have downloaded again and again.


# Random thoughts

## Thinking of new games as 'learning'
Remember in the intro how I talked about playing new games?
I talked about "learning" new games, not playing them.
I used this phrasing because it describes my mindset when thinking about _new games_.
This is sade.
As a kid I would be so excited to get a new video game.
Not all were good, and some were bad and disappointing.
But, I was at least excited to pop the disk in for the first time and start the journey.
