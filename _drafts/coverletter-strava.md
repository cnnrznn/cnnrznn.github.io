Dear Strava

I am excited to be applying for a role in Strava's server team. As an avid
hiker, runner, and cyclist I use Strava's products almost daily and would love
to contribute to Strava's performance and reliability. Strava presents a unique
opportunity to work at the intersection of technology and athletics.

In the Spring of 2020 I will graduate from Northeastern with a Master's in
Computer Science. Over the past few years, my research focus has been
distributed systems. In particular, I've been working on problems in fault
tolerance, performance, and recovery. My latest project is a testing framework
built on Docker for evaluating the performance and liveness properties of
distributed consensus systems. The framework used Docker's virtual network
environment to inject faults and inject network failure, and Docker to inject
node failure.

I have also studied operating systems and am in the process of submitting a
paper on process migration for publication in DSN'20. Process migration is the
mechanism by which running programs are paused, shipped, and resumed on new
hardware. I designed and implemented the first distributed (more than 2 nodes)
algorithm for migrating processes within a cluster.

I believe these experiences, along with my passion for distributed systems would
make me an asset to Strava's backend engineering team. It would be a great
opportunity to join you all in Denver for the Summer of 2020.

Sincerely,

Connor Zanin
