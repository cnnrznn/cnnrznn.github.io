_Hogwarts Legacy_ is a great game.
Truly, when playing this game, you can feel the magic of stepping into the world of magic.
It has gorgeous visuals and an engaging combat system, both of which prime you for a gripping adventure.
However, while I can sing this games praises I also have critiques.
These critiques, I believe, 

### Shallow choices

#### Meaningless dialogue options

#### Underutilized mechanics

#### Dark souls ending but worse

#### Fig's death feels unearned

### Movement limitations

Something that bothers me in games is when movement is arbitrarily limited.
This can happen when following an NPC, engaging in dialogue, during a cutscene, etc.
To me, this is annoying because in most cases it feels arbitrary, and because a major "fun factor" in games comes from engaging with movement systems that don't exist in real life.
Hindering movement feels like shit and I hate it.

It is also a crime that _Hogwarts Legacy_ loves to commit.

I AM SO MAD THAT I AM FORCED TO WALK IN SOME SECTIONS.
WHY DO THIS??? WHY HINDER THE PLAYER???

WHY CAN'T I FLY ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE?
THERE'S NO REASON FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO FLY THROUGH HOGSMEADE OR OVER SOME MOUNTAINS.
FOR THAT MATTER... INDOORS!

### Needless cutscenes

My favorite example of unnecessary cutscenes is during the third trial, when facing death with the elder wand.
In this section of the game, the player is moving between battle arenas where they face groups of enemies.
When arriving at the last arena, death emerges from below the side of the arena to peer over.
Instead of the player having full control when this happens, control is taken as a brief fixed camera position focuses on death, shortly to relinquish control and camera angle again to the player.

This removes gravity from the situation.
The mere size of death should naturally draw my attention, let alone the fact death appears directly ahead of where the player is coming from.
I believe the scene would be more impactful if I as the player had the control to notice the looming threat, and adjust my camera appropriately, or _turn and run_.
Because I don't have control, as a "video game player" I understand that I can't take damage or die during a cutscene, therefore the sudden emergence of a giant does not scare me or invoke terror as it could if I has the player had control and responsibility for my own safety.

I appreciate live cutscenes in games, where I have full control to stay and listen to a conversation or turn and run.
This is how real life works.
A game that does this well is _High on Life_.
In it, almost every interaction can be canceled by simply walking away.
And, for those that can't, the player still has control to position themself in the scene to achieve the camera angle that is most pleasing.
