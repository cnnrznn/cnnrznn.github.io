## Abstract

Running Hadoop or Spark locally can be a nightmare. There are many parameters
to tweak, and Java is slow, memory inefficient and the JVM imposes heap caps.

In this talk, I present an efficient MR framework, GoMR, that beats Spark on
the canonical wordcount app by an order of magnitude.

## Description

Frustrated trying to run/debug MapReduce applications on my laptop, I decided
to spin my own MR framework leveraging a moderately powerful CPU and memory
bank. Go is a compiled language and has inherent support for distribution in
the form of channels. I took advantage of these two strengths to create GoMR.

GoMR is a framework targeted for single-machine MR jobs on moderate to
high-powered machines. I do have a distributed iteration in the pipeline, but
thatâ€™s outside the scope of this talk.

In this talk, I give an overview of the framework, the programming style I
used to create it, and an evaluation of the framework against Apache Spark on
two applications.

A more complete description can be found here, and its evaluation here.

I hope this work will encourage a move away from the cumbersome JVM and spark
a next-generation of efficient distributed compute frameworks.
