## Abstract

Running Hadoop or Spark locally can be a nightmare. There are many parameters
to tweak, and Java is slow, memory inefficient and the JVM imposes heap caps.

In this talk, I present an efficient MR framework, GoMR, that beats Spark on
the canonical wordcount app by an order of magnitude.

## Description

Frustrated trying to run/debug MapReduce applications on my laptop, I decided
to spin my own MR framework to solve the problems of efficiency,
configuration, and error messages. Go is a compiled language and has inherent
support for distribution in the form of channels. I took advantage of these
two strengths to create GoMR.

In this talk, I give an overview of the framework, the programming style I
used to create it, and an evaluation of the framework against a current state
of the art system, Apache Spark.

A more complete description can be found
[here](https://connorzanin.com/distributed%20systems/MapReduce-Framework-for-Golang/),
and its evaluation
[here](https://connorzanin.com/distributed%20systems/evaluation-of-gomr/).

I hope this work will encourage a move away from the cumbersome JVM, and spark
a next-generation of efficient distributed compute frameworks.
